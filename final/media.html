            <h2>My Top 3 Artist Picks</h2>
            <p> Out of all the music I listen to again and again, these three musicians are the ones I couldn't find a bad song out of; if they tried making one.</p>

                <h3>Bring Me The Horizon</h3>
                <img src="images/bmth.jpg" alt="bmth">
                <p>They are a heavy rock band from Britain, and have been one of my favorites since early middle school. Their music got me through a lot of things and helped expresss the anger I would bottle as a kid. Making them deserve a spot in the top 3.</p>

                <h3>Chelou</h3>
                <img src="images/chelou.jpg" alt="chelou">
                <p>Chelou is the word for "weird" in french, and this artist lives up to it. He makes music that is very profound and different but always stays deep and otherwordly. This music has shaped me alot in the past few years and the creativity inspires mine.</p>

                    <img src="images/posty.jpg" alt="posty">
                    <p>This man sings/raps about many a topic I couldn't deliberately put in this website; however, he always puts his heart and feelings into it and I find it resonating. The lyrics aren't my focal point, it's more so his vocal range and music that are.</p>
