        <h2>Why Bats?</h2>
        <p class="pstyle"> 
            Because they are an interest of mine. Plus, alot of people only get the media's portrayal of these guys. 
        </p>
        <p class="pstyle">
            They aren't as scary as Halloween tries to make them.
           
            What this project is about is simply showing you some images of Chiroptras', or bats, like everyone usually calls them (unless you're a scientist).
        </p>

            Now what kind of page of mine would this be if I didn't throw out some facts? It wouldn't be.
            Bats are some of the neatest animals in the sky. From a Bumblebee bat at 33mm in size, up to the largest species: the Flying Fox bat, most of them get their day going when ours ends. 
        </p>
        <p class="pstyle">
            Bats are just as good at pollinating as other animals. Without the Mexican Long-Nosed bat, we wouldn't have tequila. The agave plant (tequila's home base) can only be pollinated by these bats. 
            As you've seen on here already, the scientific name for bat is Chiroptera; chy-rop-terra. And yes, I did use google to figure out the pronounciation.
